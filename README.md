<p align="justify"> # MVA Safe Landing Zone Detection
This repository contains the kaggle notebook (auto-synced) where I worked on coming up with the Image segmentation model and the Super Resolution model for our paper on Safe Zone detections using Image segmentation and Super Resolution presented at the 18th International Conference on Machine Vision Applications (MVA 2023) held in Hamamatsu, Japan.

The MVA_2023_Master file contains the complete pipeline of our proposed solution for Safe Zone Detection. (V1)
